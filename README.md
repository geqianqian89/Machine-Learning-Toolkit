# UFJF - MLTK (Machine Learning Toolkit)
[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/) [![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/mateus558/machine-learning-toolkit/branches/new_system/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/mateus558/machine-learning-toolkit)
## Objective
This project aims to provide researchers and developers basic tools for manipulation of datasets, implementation and test of ML algorithms
and some already implemented methods.<br />
It's not intended to be just a collection of algorithms, but also to auxiliate and create a pattern in future ML algorithms implementations
through a set of interconected modules that can be used in most ML projects.<br />

## Requirements
To compile the framework these are the requirements:
* gnuplot >= 5.0
* g++ >= 4.9.4 
* cmake (To compile using the makefile in build folder)

## Modules status
* Data manipulation - Ready to use.
* Data visualization - Ready to use.
* Classifiers (Primal and Dual) - Ready to use.
* Validation (K-Fold Cross-Validation) - Ready to use.
* Feature Selection - In development.

## Documentation
