# UFJF - MLTK (Machine Learning Toolkit)
## Objective
This project aims to provide researchers and developers basic tools for manipulation of datasets, implementation and test of ML algorithms
and some already implemented methods.<br />
It's not intended to be just a collection of algorithms, but also to auxiliate and create a pattern in future ML algorithms implementations
through a set of interconected modules that can be used in most ML projects.<br />

## Requirements
To compile the framework these are the requirements:
* gnuplot 5.0
* g++ 4.8
* cmake (To compile using the makefile in build folder)

## Documentation
You can find the documentation at the project page: [UFJF-MLTK](https://mateus558.github.io/Machine-Learning-Toolkit/index.html).
