# UFJF - MLTK (Machine Learning Toolkit)
## Objective
This project aims to provide researchers and developers basic tools for manipulation of datasets, implementation and test of ML algorithms
and some already implemented methods.<br />
It's not intended to be just a collection of algorithms, but also to auxiliate and create a pattern in future ML algorithms implementations
through a set of interconected modules that can be used in most ML projects.
